## Building the site with Jekyll ##

The site is designed to be built with Jekyll 3.3.1+. To build the site, first install jekyll, then run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd src/
$ jekyll build
```

The built site will be stored in '\_site/'.

Alternatively, you can build and serve the site locally for testing:

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

A development server will run at http://localhost:4000.
