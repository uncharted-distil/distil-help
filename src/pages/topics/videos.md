The following videos demonstrate how to use Distil. Each video focuses on a different aspect of the workflow scenarios outlined in the previous sections.

## Overview ##

In this video, you will see the complete Distil workflow, from finding a relevant dataset, to creating predictive models and refining them with data augmentation services.

## Task 1: Problem discovery ##

In this video, you will learn how to [build and export a problem specification](problem-discovery-overview.html) for the acceleration feature in a preselected automotive dataset.

{% include video.html src="vid/distil-workflow-task-1-problem-discovery.mp4" %}

## Task 2: Model generation ##

In this video, you will learn how to [create predictive models](model-generation-overview.html) from a preselected automotive dataset.

{% include video.html src="vid/distil-workflow-task-2-model-generation.mp4" %}

## Forecasting timeseries data ##

In this workflow, you will learn how to guide Distil to build a forecasting models.

## Data augmentation ##

In this workflow, you will learn how to find a dataset, [add relevant data to it](workflow-overview.html) and guide Distil to build a predictive model.
