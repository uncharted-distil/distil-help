In this workflow, you will learn how to find a dataset, add relevant data to it and guide Distil to build a predictive model. Your task in this scenario is to categorize and predict conflict events from Middle East conflict report data. The workflow has five main steps:

1. [Select a dataset](select-data.html)
2. [Select a target feature](select-target.html)
3. [Create the models](create-models.html)
4. [Join a dataset](join-datasets.html)
5. [View the models](view-models.html)

The following video focuses on the View models and Join dataset portions of the workflow.
